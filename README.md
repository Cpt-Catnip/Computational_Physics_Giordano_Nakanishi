# Computational_Physics_Giordano_Nakanishi
A comprehensive review of computational physics in python. These notebooks shouldn't be used as a replacement for studdying the text and aren't really even meant to be a supplementary study guide. 

I decided to start this project for two reasons: the first is that, when I first started, I was about to graduate from undergrad and therefore was going to lose my Matlab lisence; I decided that going through this text in Python would be a great way to hone my coding skills in a language I didn't feel completely confident in. The second reason is that near the end of my undergraduate career I began to feel frustrated with my classes and felt I wasn't getting everything I wanted out of them. I remembered really enjoying computational physics when I used this text in a class at Skidmore College, so I decided to return to it and study it at my own pace and in my own time. 

Although this is mostly for personal use and isn't meant to be a study guide of any kind, I hope that somebody might find it useful.

Thank you.
